### Game for writing the smallest number of combine operators?
There's a set of problems on hackerrank/leetcode/codewars.
Each of the problems has a description, the set of test cases. Also there're hidden test cases.
The result must be only one publisher, with a lot of operators.
The list of operators is given.
The problems are kind of real-life.
Some kind of a preprocessor can check if really only one publisher was used.

- [ ] create a **one** problem :D
- [ ] choose most convenient platform
- [ ] implement "current best score" logic, preferably with the tools of platform
