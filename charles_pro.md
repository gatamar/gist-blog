Charles Proxy is cool, but not so easy to learn.
Even if Charles is set up and some kind of commercial license is added, is't not enough (I lived a few month thinking that I intercept requests from Xcode Simulator, but that was only half true).

## Setup 
In `Proxy > SSL Proxy Settings` "\*" should be added to "Location".x
`Help > SSL Proxying > Install Charles Root Certificate in iOS Simulators` should be checked to install certificate to Simulator

## Questions

1. How to monitor only the specific endpoints, not all that noise?
2. How to make MacOS browsers work??
3. Is it possible to autotest such stuff like "count of requests to some endpoint" in Charles?
