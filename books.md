So I'm using Goodreads for quite a long time. It has a nice feature called "reading challenge" - you can set a number of books you want to read this year, and then it shows you a current percentage of the books read.
I don't like this feature, but it has a great side-effect: a personal dashboard of the books read this year. This is mine: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/38693364

But Goodreads allows me only to track books, and doesn't provide them for reading. And I was feeling guilty for a long time - because the post-Soviet worldview allowed me to read pirate books. When I read some great book, especially technical, I felt quilty that the author is actually my fellow, they have (or have not) a job, family etc. 
And here is me, reading the book someone stolen and put to the well-known pirate books site.

When I bought a subscription for http://raywenderlich.com/, I started feeling better.
But still, there great tech books which are not so iOS-ish, e.g. this one: https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-and-reactive/9781617292248.
