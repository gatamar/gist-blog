### Intro
I used to read a lot. It even was a part of my identity. 
Reading is great in so many senses, I can't even enumerate them all:
+ you get new info, the "unknown unknown" 
+ you get an information very quickly - through skimming/automatic search. It's not linear (like video), it's faster
+ you learn a new language intuitively with your neural network, not by the learning rules
+ at some point, you start writing by yourself

### All books: Goodreads

So I'm using Goodreads for quite a long time. It has a nice feature called "reading challenge" - you can set a number of books you want to read this year, and then it shows you a current percentage of the books read.
I don't like this feature, but it has a great side-effect: a personal dashboard of the books read this year. This is mine: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/38693364

But Goodreads allows me only to track books, and doesn't provide them for reading. And I was feeling guilty for a long time - because the post-Soviet worldview allowed me to read pirate books. When I read some great book, especially technical, I felt quilty that the author is actually my fellow, they have (or have not) a job, family etc. 
And here is me, reading the book someone stolen and put to the well-known pirate books site.

### Technical books: Subscriptions

When I bought a subscription for http://raywenderlich.com/, I started feeling better.
But still, there great tech books which are not so iOS-ish, e.g. this one: https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-and-reactive/9781617292248.

Electronic!

#### Possible issues
TODO:
+ pirate books
+ the situation when another "editing house" is publishing some addison-wisley counterfact books
+ so can I quote freely?
+ authors are afraid of ebooks because of the piracy
