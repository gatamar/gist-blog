## ðŸŽ¬ Create your custom MOVIE

So I have a bunch of videos from the hiking mountain trip.
Now I want to make a "movie" and post in on Youtube via a private link.
I have two apps installed: iMovie and LumaFusion, and they say it's more than enough.
I'm very new to this stuff, so the UX seems terrible to me in the both apps.

This is an "algorithm" of how I see such movie creation:
1. Prepare a folder with the videos I want to merge into a one "movie".
2. Merge that videos into a one big movie.
3. Speed up some chunks of the movie as they are not so dynamic.
4. Remove some chunks of the movie as they are not so interesting/appropriate.
5. Make spoilers - copy some chunks of the movie and insert them at the beginning of the movie.
6. For some chunks of the movie, remove the sound.
6. For some chunks of the movie, overlay the music.
7. For some chunks of the movie, overlay the text.
8. For some chunks of the movie, overlay my voice with some comments.
8. Insert photos into some places between the frames.
9. Make animations at the edges.
