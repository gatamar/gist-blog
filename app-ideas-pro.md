## motivation

This is a gist where I store all the ideas for the apps/services I could create but don't have skills/time/energy/reasons/whatever. I don't think that these ideas are "valuable" or that someone can "steal" them. Just warming up my brain.
Also I don't search for the existing solutions before writing a dump: with a 100% probability there's a solution which covers 80-90% of my requirements, but what about the other 10%?

### a mobile app for journaling

This app should be secure. There should be a password for the app to enter.
It should be very simple: each use of the app should cost a user less than a minute.
Why? Because the brain work in such way.

Let's tell a preamble. In 2019 or 2018 I read a book by Gerald Weinberg "Becoming a Technical Leader". I hadn't understood how to become a leader, but I got some insight on how to be more self-aware. The main (or the only?) practical advice was to use journaling. I created a google doc, which I'm using even now. My journaling is neither frequent nor systematic. I try to drive it, not to be driven by the "habit".

So, there're some states of mind when the journaling is useful for me:
+ some events happened (travelled, met new people, a big PR was merged, got some gift, was shocked by some news): need to write a "tagged snapshot" with the main facts
+ the mind is burned out, "nothing happens" and/or the work/life is sucking: need to monotonically write an unsystematic dump, use obscene and depressive language, and hopefully feel a little bit better at the end     
+ feel some negative emotions about some situation which should be analyzed but at the moment I don't have the time and/or energy: tag the situation and emotion
+ feel an urge to think about smth, but then forget that idea within a minute: dump the idea, return to it later
+ feel the need to systematize smth, have the time, but don't have energy
+ feel the rage about smth (a car flies near me when my light is green) which shouldn't be analyzed, but the following journal dumps may be affected by this: tag an event, and specify the type of hormonal reaction: rage/fear/etc

That's all. I hope I won't do it. I've had about the app called Stoic, and saw the iPad UI. Don't remember it, but it looked non-minimalistic, not able to make a dump in 30 seconds.
I'll just clarify: this dumping app shouldn't be a text editor like google doc with autocomplete, undo/redo etc. It should define the structure and an approximate timing of my thought an feelings, being able to automatically find a dependencies, but the main dumps can still be made in the google docs.

### a coffeshop with a strong coffee and no sounds

This a caffe where you can a strong, caffeinated, spicy (cinnamon/cardamon/etc) coffee, sit and drink it, and don't talk to the other people (even the ones you are sitting with). No music, no other sounds.
Location: either some basement, or an oper-air. A lot of green plants. Soft light. Just a strong coffee and silence. 
Taste: no milk, no sugar (or maybe a little bit of sugar or sweets for the coffee?). 

What I described now accidentally reminded me of some "vacuum rooms" for biohackers. Just googled it and it's called a "Sensory Deprivation Tank". Never had been in such, but the coffee in actually an antonym to "deprivation".

### a game for writing the smallest number of combine operators?
There's a set of problems on hackerrank/leetcode/codewars.
Each of the problems has a description, the set of test cases. Also there're hidden test cases.
The result must be only one publisher, with a lot of operators.
The list of operators is given.
The problems are kind of real-life.
Some kind of a preprocessor can check if really only one publisher was used.

- [ ] create a **one** problem :D
- [ ] choose most convenient platform
- [ ] implement "current best score" logic, preferably with the tools of platform
