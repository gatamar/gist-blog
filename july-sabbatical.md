Each year I try to have a sabbatical in July. Sabbatical means I request an unpaid leave on my full-time job.
I guess this may seem at least unusual, so would like to explain(without sharing too much details, right?).

I like summer. I was born in August, which means each year in July/August I become more experienced, and there's a one less summer for me to enjoy. 
So if e.g. I'll live N years more from now, it becomes N-1. <br>
I guess this stuff is related to the continious vs discrete "feeling" of time, and all I know is that the time flies.
As you may have guessed, existential crisis flourishes each July.

> An existential crisis means we have the opportunity to get back in touch with our values, meaning and purpose, and with what we want to make of our lives. This can help us evaluate, plan and adapt our actions and direction in order to lead the life we want and will be happy with.

I don't know how it will be in the future, but for the previous few years, my salary has been pretty good comparing to the cost of leaving (it's not because I'm so cool, it's just a combination of a different geopolitical factors; while I'm good enough). 
Which means in general I can afford it. And even if I couldn't, I can e.g. request all "paid" PTO days, and a few more "unpaid" days to cover whole July (like I did while switching the job; it's just the details).

TODO:
+ why I feel that I can't miss that 2 sprints and not help the team
+ what do I usually do
+ why do I do pet projects
+ synchronisity, and why not having goals is good
+ why does my body loves this month as it's warm
+ why does full time job takes the most of my creative energy each day
