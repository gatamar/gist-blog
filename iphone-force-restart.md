Each time it's different and each time it sucks.
My iPhone XR hanges for the second time. The fist time was when either profiling or debugging about 2 yrs ago, this time it was when profiling, but the main culprit was the Okta app.
So the Okta's app screen was frozen (I guess in the "springboard" daemon, whatever this means). I could swipe to the notifications screen, or the "app search" screen, but no more (after I seached for the app, and tried to open any of them, the Okta stuff was still shown).

The solution log:
1. started panicking
2. tried [this advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnER1berAro), it was correct, but didn't help; accidentally called emergency service (`VolumeDown`+`Sleep` buttons)
3. gave it a break
4. tried [**this one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAzXsnOR03I), it worked (while it's the same as in p.2)
5. restarted the iPhone, the issue disappeared

Let's repeat it: 
1. get your fingers out of the device
2. quickly press the `VolumeUp`, quickly release it
3. quickly press the `VolumeDown`, quickly release it
4. quickly press the `Sleep`, don't release it until the apple logo appears (it can take even more then 30sec I guess) 

Thanks Instruments for your heavy work ðŸ˜…
