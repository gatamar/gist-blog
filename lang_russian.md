I am very grateful to the Russian language for that endless amount of books/songs I've had in my life. As I was born and lived in Western Ukraine, I was lucky not to speak it, not to have it in school. So always wondered why >= 50% of Kyiv speaks Russian (answer: their grandparents were intentionally shuffled within the large USSR, so the "common" language was established; the English language history isn't perfect also, condolescences to Ireland/India/Africa/First Americans etc).
Now (after the full scale war started Feb 2022 with all this terrorism) I feel a physical disgust to this language (the nervous system activated, an emotional response triggered within a short period of time, you know). It's not rational, but quite logical. And I hope AMAP of Ukrainians switched to Ukrainian language after the war started back in 2014, or at least in 2022, so after we win, these fucking russian bastards will not have a chance again to manipulate that they are protecting russian-speaking people.

### Let me repeat it again: 
1. Olha, not Olga
2. Bohdan, not Bogdan
3. Kyiv 🇺🇦, not Kiev  

I'm still using Russian language when it's needed, still read and listen in it; still grateful.

### UPD
just found that russian language is triggering me in work Slack 🙁
