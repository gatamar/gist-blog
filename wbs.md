### Work Breakdown Structure

This is one of the appproaches which combines handling requirements and managing estimates.
The main idea is that we divide work recursively into smaller chunks, until it can be divided. Then we estimate each of those undividable chunks, sum them up, aand ... we are done.
But unfortunately, this works only in a perfect world.

Here's an example of a WBS template I've created for my job and a pet project:

And it sucks. Here're the main points why:

1. Format
2. Initial breakdown
3. Unexpected work types
4. Diff management
