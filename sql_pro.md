I've had a quite good SQL course at university, or I thinked so. 
We've covered all SQL syntax constructions, and even did a coursework which was a desktop|web app (in my case, it was rental service), so the ER scheme was created,
it was checked to conform to some of the SQL "normalization" forms. And JDBC-similar stuff (ORM wrappers) were used to manage DB from the code.
So it was about the domain modeling and implementation.

Now, as I worked few times with:
+ sqlite db (iOS mobile) 
+ athena db (AWS)

I've realized that I know almost nothing. 
Currently having an issue with writing a complex ("nested"? "built in"?) SQL query which parses and filters by a value from JSON column. ðŸ˜…

Stuff I plan to process _maybe sometimes_:
+ [SQL performance explained book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17225810-sql-performance-explained)
+ [Use the index Luke - a client of the above book](https://use-the-index-luke.com/)
+ [Amazon Athena DB course](https://cloudacademy.com/course/aws-big-data-athena/amazon-athena-introduction-1/) 
+ [SQL tutorial from Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)
