### Intro

So you've registered at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) or another online chess server. You play a bullet - which 1 min game without time additions - and you suck.
In this series of articles I share my intuition about blitz chess and a bullet in general. Hope it'll be useful for you.

### Which game duration to choose?
You can play 1min, 3min+2s, 5min, 15min or any other duration. Please understand: that's different chess, they require different strategies to win, and you develop different personal skills while playing these chess.
In a bullet, you must deliver an average quality in a very short time in order to win. You should quickly assess opponent's psychology. You should embrace the risk.

I was a national Candidate Master when I last played in tournaments about 6 years ago. I played 90min, 65 min etc. Now I can't imagine doing this - there're a plenty of other intellectual activities which produce some long-term value and compensation. But I play a bullet - it's not "convenient chess". :)
Besides from not willing to spend time on "long" chess, I guess I'd not be able to produce a good enough quality. My brain will see a bunch of "good enough" moves very quickly, but it'd be very hard and painful for it to see the "best" move.

So if you are learning chess, want to get some title, and play stronger - don't play a bullet! It can deteriorate you chess vision and slow down the progress. You'll unlearn how to look for the best move.
If you want to speed up your brain, experience some adrenalin (and sometimes cortisol) boost, and switch from an activity which requires deep concentration - you should try a bullet.

I the next article I plan to show some approaches to the optimal game opening.
