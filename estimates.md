## Estimation
`‚è∞ date: 03.04.2021 ü™¢ tags: #estimates`

I'm very bad at estimating the duration of my work. Recently I had an insight - I'd never actually estimated stuff. I just guessed. Estimation is a skill, and it has a framework.
There're such important variables:
### WBS 
a decomposition of a problem into smaller problems, each of which can be estimated more easily and precisely.
### Units
in a perfect (contractors?) world it would be hours. But in a real world, where we have messengers/ meetings/coffetalks/etc it's something more rough as storypoints/days/halfdays.
### Estimation technique 
a particular approach to calculating an estimate based on type of a problem, estimator's experience in solving such problems, risks involved etc.
### Historical data 
a documented experience of previously solved problems. Can be very useful combined with WBS, when at some level of an hierarchy we meet a task 100% similar to what we've solved earlier.

Btw, when I was reading a Clean Coder book by Uncle Bob, there was an estimation technique described. It was strange and superficial, but better than nothing. It was PERT technique: SomeLinearFormula(optimistic,normal,pessimistic). There was nothing about WBS in those particular chapter.
