So I'm watched [this course made by Curtis Einsmann](https://app.gumroad.com/d/96a466204a34554ae86ea025ca48985d) and it's great.
It helps to structure the values, goals and approaches related to the code review process.
And this file isn't a conspect of the course, but is heavily inspired by the course.

### emotionally uncomfortable things
+ my PR was assigned to some people, not my teammates, and they don't seem to look into it. Especially if that people are some lead engineers, and that PR is a small "infra" one, like a Podfile change, or a Codeowners file change.<br>
  **solution**: wait for 24 hours, then ping them in Slack without a hesitation. as a code review is blocker, there should be some balance btw the speed of it, and the fact that the reviewers also have some high prio stuff to handle
+ someone asks me to change a Swift line with `extension` to a `private extension`, and I know I should have checked that by myself, but feel irritated as it's more about the style, than about the clean code / compiler optimization, and I always forget to check that. The same stuff for a `final class` vs `class`.<br>
  **solution**: either push that to be added to a linter, or create a local linter helper. The hardest part of it is of course the context: should that extension really be a `private` one?
+ I don't like some change, but can't decide if it's a blocker<br>
  **solution**: TODO

### communication patterns (to be structured)

> debatable: you should disagree when you have a stronger reason why

> if the review requested the changes, and you agree with them, and you made an update, before pushing:
pair program if necessary: Am I on the right track?

> team level code review principles

...: I could've refactored this, I could've changed that. I didn't make these changes to keep the PR as simple as possible.
Out of scope
The updated Figma show THIS when THAT happens. We need to WAIT for THAT and/or do THAT. I'll work on it, but it shouldn't be a blocker for this feature.
Will set up a separate PR for the SMTH. A follow up ticket: LINK.

I am a ðŸ‘Ž  on SMTH if it doesn't have a good use case.

We can add this in the future if there is a good use case to display....
```

```
Hi NAME, your approval persisted when I pushed a new revision. The diff changed slightly - added SMTH and deleted SMTH_ELSE. Is it good to merge?
```

```
THIS CODE should also support THIS EDGE_CASE I think?
...
Same here, probably need to add EDGE_CASE_HANDLER too?
