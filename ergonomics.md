### Motivation

Recently I was doing some course (and an exam) related to Foundations of Work Safety (don't the exact term in English). It had a lot of norms, numbers, and regulations about what's wrong and what's right in the working environment. 
And there was a module on ergonomics. I'll dump my setup here, because the topic is important.

### Setup  

#### Chair
Doesn't matter for me. It should be OK, and it should be less than 50$. A regular office desk, without custom angles / leather / armrests should be fine.

#### Desk
It must be a standing desk. It should be big. Hell, it's expensive. The main requirement is about an ability to regulate its height, with respect to my height. As it's expensive, the regulating mechanism can be manual - you just rotate the "wheel", and the desk is changing it's height. I don't understand people who pay 30%-50% more for an automatic regulating mechanism, given that the height is usually changed maximum 3-4 times per day, and each time it takes 30 seconds (and you warm up your hands, and turn off from a monitor for 30 seconds, so *it's not a waste of time*). 

#### Monitor
The bigger the better, but no more than e.g. 30 inches (no, I don't need a cinema screen). Monitors are not that expensive. E.g. my usual 4K monitor costs 6 time less than MacBook Pro.
Also, MacBook laptops have great displays, so at least a few hours per day it's possible to work without an external monitor.
Also, I'm not choosy about pixel quality, I don't know a hardware part of it. All I need is a comfort when writing a lot of text, be it Xcode, Confluence, Slack or whatever.

#### Light
I need a sun light. If the room doesn't have windows, it can be perfectly lighted, but depression is unavoilable. The brain just doesn't like it.
Except of the sun light, I need a light bulb - the brighter the better.

#### Sound 
Each summer a construction work are being performed near the flat I rent. Sometimes they are in the same building (a lot of people who live in a flat instead of a house have *that neighbour* who is renovating his/her flat for months). Do I have a headphones? Yes. Do I want to listen to some white noise etc? No.
I listen to music during the work sometimes, when I want, not when an external environment is being crazy. I also tried earplugs, they are good, but first, there's this hygienic risk when plugging them 2+ times; second, my brain doesn't like it, just like an artificial light.
