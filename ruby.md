Ruby is a cool scripting language. I met the mentions of it in Fowler's books, e.g. DSL book. However I was lucky enough not to interact with it _directly_ until Feb 2022.

I thought is an analogue of Python, so as I ~~love~~ like Python, why should I learn analogue? It seems today I've undestood the reason of why Ruby got a popularity, and why I need to manage its multiple versions on my machine.
The reason is the products. Ruby is used for iOS dev tools, not Python. So the nightmare with `which python` and `pip install` translates to Ruby.
`virtualenv` becomes `rbenv` and so on.
