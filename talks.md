I'm reading a [nice book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41969500) on doing good talks. I constantly map advices from this book to technical talks (while I'm not sure this always works).
The main idea is that you talk should have a purpose - any purpose, not nessarily to make the world better - and that you should know what you're going to tell.

There're a lot of techiques to achieve your talks' purpose.
One of these techiques is storytelling.

Now, possible scenarios applying to tech talks:
1. Main character - life was good, but everything dramatically changed with iOS update / dangerous decision - problem resolved - life is good again.
2. Main character - did smth in some way - protagonist - did the same stuff in a different way - conflict - main character changes.
3. Idea - cool stories to demonstate it: Point - Story - Point: when repeated again after the story, idea sticks better.

I'd like to have a collection of cool stories. Those stories must be technical. A personal (job-related) experience is great, but it's sooo limited by time/abilities/legacy etc.
Possible sources of tech cool stories: StackOverflow, Apple Developer Forums, Reddit, Github.
Of course, there's mostly raw info in those places, but this info is actual.
